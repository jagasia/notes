1) image upload from angular to spring controller	
	(byte[] in java.	@Lob in Entity class) in oracle it is Blob
	clob can be used in oracle and char[] in java (for char large objects)

3) many to many relationship jpa repository
	Student-Courses
		please represent this M-M with additional table called Enrollment
	Student - Enrollment - Course
	Student - Enrollment	(1 to M)
	Course - Enrollment	(1 to M)

	@OneToMany			any annotation ends with Many will create a new table
		to avoid that use	mappedBy="students"
	private List<Enrollment> en;
4) date field

	in html form, we enter date using <input type=date>
	this will give date in yyyy-MM-dd

	angular creates a json (create a class in angular and define this field as date)
	

if the form contains only image upload and you want to update image in a record, 
it is simple

Person
	id
	name
	age
	pic


while adding a person, id, name, age can be done in one form

in next form, upload your image
	that is easy

between these 2 pages, how will you remember the id?
	session / state management
		localStorage
	controller is a servlet. that means cookies, session, etc is allowed
	session.invalidate()


in any typescript page, 
	uid=localStorage.getItem("userName");
	if(uid == null)
		you have not logge din
	else
		welcome kumar 
	localStorage.setItem("userName","jag");
